# Apache APISIX Dashboard

[APISIX Dashboard](https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard/) is designed to make it as easy as possible for users to operate Apache APISIX through a frontend interface.

This chart bootstraps an apisix-dashboard deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

APISIX Dashboard requires Kubernetes version 1.14+.

## Get Repo Info

```console
helm repo add apisix https://charts.apiseven.com
helm repo update
```

## Install Chart

**Important:** only helm3 is supported

```console
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] apisix/apisix-dashboard
```

The command deploys apisix-dashboard on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.

_See [configuration](#configuration) below._

_See [helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) for command documentation._

## Uninstall Chart

```console

```

This removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
