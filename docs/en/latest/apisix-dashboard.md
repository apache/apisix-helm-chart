> In short:

> while the brand new Dashboard will be directly integrated into APISIX,
> eliminating the need for the current chart.
>
> For details, please see <https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard/issues/2981>.
>
> If you are still using the old version of the APISIX Dashboard,
> you can continue to use the chart.
